## Overview
Project is to create a new visual studio code that is sleek and elegant. I would like to have a light and dark theme, and an option to toggle between the two. Not sure if VSCode will allow for that. Light theme will feature an off white body for the editor, and shades of white (edging towards grays) in the body of the different panes. Accents will feature a soft orange. Dark theme will replace the whites with dark grays that lighten in the panes. Same orange. Want to use variants of oranges and complimentary colors for the text theming.
## Setting up project and Environments
1. My computer has installed Python (only for managing the virtual environments) and the python module `nodeenv`.
